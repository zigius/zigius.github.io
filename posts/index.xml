Recently I started using the quickfix list in vim, a hidden gem in the vim ecosystem. The main reason I started working with the qf list is I wanted a way to search and replace text in multiple files in my project.
getting started - search I use telescope and FZF as my search plugins, but they do not provide replace functionality out of the box.</description></item><item><title>Create Neovim Plugin</title><link>https://zigius.github.io/posts/create-neovim-plugin/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 15:57:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://zigius.github.io/posts/create-neovim-plugin/</guid><description>DISCLAMER: This blog post will be updated every time i improve the workflow I use when creating plugins

One of the scenarios we wanted to be able to monitor, was a case where a partition has been unintentinally deleted from an athena table
We decided we will use S3 inventory to monitor this flow.
This is how we do it:
First let&amp;rsquo;s try and break down the pseudo code we need to write:

Let&amp;rsquo;s assume we have a datalake containing more than 3PB of data. The raw data is saved as compressed parquet files in S3. We query our datalake using athena. We needed a way to monitor our data to be able to quickly detect issues in our data pipeline.

Storing images I store my notes in a github repo, and of course also locally on my laptop and phone.</description></item><item><title>The story of the content-length header</title><link>https://zigius.github.io/posts/nodejs_content_length_timeout/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 15:59:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://zigius.github.io/posts/nodejs_content_length_timeout/</guid><description>As part of my job, Me and my team are responsible for the data pipeline of our division. Our collection layer of all the analytics events is written in typescript with an express server. It is responsible for handling and processing more than 3M requests every minute.
As part of a rewrite of the collection layer, we noticed that we have requests that take more than a minute to progress.
